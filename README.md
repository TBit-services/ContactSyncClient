PeopleSync Client App
=====================

Please see the [PeopleSync product website](http://peoplesync.messageconcept.com) for
detailed information about the software.

The software is a CardDAV client for businesses using our PeopleSync server
software. It synchronizes all address lists from the PeopleSync server. The
management, which address lists will be synchronized, happens centrally on
server side by the IT staff. Therefore for the personal usage of CardDAV and
CalDAV we recommend to use the [DAVx⁵](https://www.davx5.com)
app with more configuration options.


The PeopleSync client app is licensed under the [GPLv3 License](LICENSE).

The PeopleSync server software is proprietary commercial software.
